# FinFest-Game-2021
 The computer club finfest game for 2021 in unity c#.
 
 Consists of three minigames, each having a sudden death mode. The points at the end are the score the player gets from the three games combined.
 
 Made in unity version 2018.4.2f. If you want to compile and use the game for a future event, you have to use that version.
 
 Known Bugs:
 
 In the last game, it is possible to survive forever put constantly pressing the down key, since it allows you to stay there while shooting lasers. One way to change this is by increasing speed or by increasing the ranges of spawn. 
 
 The second game can be problematic. The ball always bounced 90 degrees, which makes it too predictable.
